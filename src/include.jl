    @include(path::AbstractString)

Prefix `path` with the JustSayIt application config path and then call `include(path)`. If `path` is an absolut path, then call `include` with `path` unmodified.

!!! note "NOTE: JustSayIt application config"
    The content of the JustSayIt application config folder is not evaluated within JustSayIt. The folder's single purpose is to provide an easily accessible storage for scripts to start JustSayIt and/or for custom command functions: `@include` permits to conveniently `include` files from this folder (for details about the Julia built-in `include` type `?include`).
    Your JustSayIt application config path on this system is: `$CONFIG_PREFIX`
