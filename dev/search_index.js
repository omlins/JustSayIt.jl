Type ?Keyboard.type for information about typing or say \"help type\" after having started JustSayIt.\ncommands::Dict{String, <:Any}=DEFAULT_COMMANDS[default_language]: the commands to be recognized with their mapping to a function or to a keyboard key or shortcut or a sequence of any of those.\nsubset::AbstractArray{String}=nothing: a subset of the commands to be recognised and executed (instead of the complete commands list).\nmax_speed_subset::AbstractArray{String}=nothing: a subset of the commands for which the command names (first word of a command) are to be recognised with maxium speed rather than with maximum accuracy. Forcing maximum speed is usually desired for single word commands that map to functions or keyboard shortcuts that should trigger immediate actions as, e.g., mouse clicks or page up/down (in general, actions that do not modify content and can therefore safely be triggered at maximum speed). Note that forcing maximum speed means not to wait for a certain amount of silence after the end of a command as normally done for the full confirmation of a recognition. As a result, it enables a minimal latency between the saying of a command name and its execution. Note that it is usually possible to define very distinctive command names, which allow for a safe command name to shortcut mapping at maximum speed (to be tested case by case).\n\nnote: Advanced\nmodeldirs::Dict{String, String}: the directories where the unziped speech recognition models to be used are located. If modeldirs is not set, then it is automatically defined according to the default_language and type_languages set. Models are downloadable from here: https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models\nnoises::Dict{String, <:AbstractArray{String}}=DEFAULT_NOISES: for each model, an array of strings with noises (tokens that are to be ignored in the speech as, e.g., \"huh\").\naudio_input_cmd::Cmd=nothing: a command that returns an audio stream to replace the default audio recorder. The audio stream must fullfill the following properties: samplerate=44100, channels=1 and format=Int16 (signed 16-bit integer).\n\nSubmodules for command name to function mapping\n\nHelp\nKeyboard\nMouse\nEmail\nInternet\n\nTo see a description of a submodule, type ?<modulename>.\n\nExamples\n\nDefine default_language (also used for typing if type_languages is not set)\n\n# Set command and type language to french:\nusing JustSayIt\nstart(default_language=\"fr\")\n\nDefine default_language and type_languages\n\n# Set command language to french and type languages to french and spanish:\nusing JustSayIt\nstart(default_language=\"fr\", type_languages=[\"fr\",\"es\"])\n\nDefine subset\n\n# Listen only to the commands \"help\" and \"type\".\nusing JustSayIt\nstart(subset=[\"help\", \"type\"])\n\nDefine custom commands - functions, keyboard shortcuts and sequences of those - and a max_speed_subset\n\nusing JustSayIt\ncommands = Dict(\"help\"      => Help.help,\n                \"type\"      => Keyboard.type,\n                \"ma\"        => Mouse.click_left,\n                \"select\"    => Mouse.press_left,\n                \"okay\"      => Mouse.release_left,\n                \"middle\"    => Mouse.click_middle,\n                \"right\"     => Mouse.click_right,\n                \"double\"    => Mouse.click_double,\n                \"triple\"    => Mouse.click_triple,\n                \"copy\"      => (Key.ctrl, 'c'),\n                \"cut\"       => (Key.ctrl, 'x'),\n                \"paste\"     => (Key.ctrl, 'v'),\n                \"undo\"      => (Key.ctrl, 'z'),\n                \"redo\"      => (Key.ctrl, Key.shift, 'z'),\n                \"upwards\"   => Key.page_up,\n                \"downwards\" => Key.page_down,\n                \"take\"      => [Mouse.click_double, (Key.ctrl, 'c')],\n                \"replace\"   => [Mouse.click_double, (Key.ctrl, 'v')],\n                );\nstart(commands=commands, max_speed_subset=[\"ma\", \"select\", \"okay\", \"middle\", \"right\", \"double\", \"triple\", \"copy\", \"upwards\", \"downwards\", \"take\"])\n\nDefine custom modeldirs\n\nusing JustSayIt\nmodeldirs = Dict(MODELNAME.DEFAULT.EN_US => \"/home/runner/mymodels/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15\",\n                 MODELNAME.TYPE.EN_US    => \"/home/runner/mymodels/vosk-model-en-us-daanzu-20200905\",\n                 MODELNAME.DEFAULT.FR    => \"/home/runner/mymodels/vosk-model-small-fr-0.22\",\n                 MODELNAME.TYPE.FR       => \"/home/runner/mymodels/vosk-model-fr-0.6-linto-2.2.0\")\nstart(modeldirs=modeldirs, default_language=\"en-us\", type_languages=[\"en-us\",\"fr\"])\n\nDefine audio_input_cmd\n\n# Use a custom command to create the audio input stream - instead of the default recorder (the rate, channels and format must not be chosen different!)\nusing JustSayIt\naudio_input_cmd = `arecord --rate=44100 --channels=1 --format=S16_LE`\nstart(audio_input_cmd=audio_input_cmd)\n\nDefault commands\n\nde    => Dict{String, Function}(\"email\" => JustSayIt.Email.email, \"internet\" => JustSayIt.Internet.internet, \"hilfe\" => JustSayIt.Help.help, \"schreibe\" => JustSayIt.Keyboard.type)\nen-us => Dict{String, Function}(\"help\" => JustSayIt.Help.help, \"type\" => JustSayIt.Keyboard.type, \"email\" => JustSayIt.Email.email, \"internet\" => JustSayIt.Internet.internet)\nes    => Dict{String, Function}(\"ayuda\" => JustSayIt.Help.help, \"escribe\" => JustSayIt.Keyboard.type, \"internet\" => JustSayIt.Internet.internet, \"email\" => JustSayIt.Email.email)\nfr    => Dict{String, Function}(\"écrire\" => JustSayIt.Keyboard.type, \"aide\" => JustSayIt.Help.help, \"internet\" => JustSayIt.Internet.internet, \"email\" => JustSayIt.Email.email)\n\nDefault model directories\n\ndefault-de    => /home/runner/.local/share/JustSayIt/models/vosk-model-small-de-0.15\ndefault-en-us => /home/runner/.local/share/JustSayIt/models/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15\ndefault-es    => /home/runner/.local/share/JustSayIt/models/vosk-model-small-es-0.22\ndefault-fr    => /home/runner/.local/share/JustSayIt/models/vosk-model-small-fr-0.22\ntype-de       => /home/runner/.local/share/JustSayIt/models/vosk-model-de-0.21\ntype-en-us    => /home/runner/.local/share/JustSayIt/models/vosk-model-en-us-daanzu-20200905\ntype-es       => \ntype-fr       => /home/runner/.local/share/JustSayIt/models/vosk-model-fr-0.22\n\nDefault noises\n\ndefault-de    => String[]\ndefault-en-us => [\"huh\"]\ndefault-es    => String[]\ndefault-fr    => [\"hum\"]\ntype-de       => String[]\ntype-en-us    => [\"huh\"]\ntype-es       => String[]\ntype-fr       => [\"hum\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"software/#JustSayIt.@include_config","page":"Software reference","title":"JustSayIt.@include_config","text":"@include_config(path::AbstractString)\n\nPrefix path with the JustSayIt application config path and then call include(path).
